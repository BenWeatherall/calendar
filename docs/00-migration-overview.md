# Calendar Application Migration Plan: HTML/JS to Svelte 5

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for migrating the current calendar application from a single HTML file with embedded JavaScript to a modern Svelte 5 application with proper frontend/backend separation, Google Cloud integration, and production-ready architecture.

## Project Goals

- **Framework Migration**: Move from vanilla HTML/JS to Svelte 5
- **Architecture Modernization**: Implement proper frontend/backend separation
- **Cloud Integration**: Connect to Google Cloud services via backend API
- **Security Enhancement**: Implement IAP-based authentication and secure data handling
- **Data Integrity**: Add soft deletes and audit trails
- **Design Preservation**: Maintain current UI/UX design and behavior
- **Production Readiness**: Ensure robust, tested, scalable solution

## Current Application Analysis

### Existing Features
- **Calendar Views**: Day, week, month, year views using dhtmlxScheduler
- **Event Management**: Create, edit, delete events with rich metadata
- **Event Properties**: Description, location, priority, tags, attendees, category
- **Visual Organization**: Events grouped by tags in collapsible sidebar
- **Color Coding**: Priority and category-based event styling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic sidebar updates based on current view

### Technical Stack (Current)
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- dhtmlxScheduler library for calendar functionality
- Vanilla JavaScript for event handling
- Node.js backend (implied from data endpoints)

## Target Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 with SvelteKit
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended for audit trails)
- **Authentication**: Google IAP Proxy
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud APIs
- **Testing**: Vitest (frontend), Jest (backend)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Docker containers

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear frontend/backend boundaries
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API with proper versioning
- **Security by Design**: IAP integration, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Audit Trail**: Complete change tracking with timestamps and user attribution
- **Scalability**: Modular components, efficient data fetching
- **Maintainability**: TypeScript, comprehensive testing, documentation
